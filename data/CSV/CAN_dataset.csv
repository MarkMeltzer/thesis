The Framework Contract resulting from this tender procedure is to provide products and services to support and maintain the Eurosur network and to provide changes to its functionalities and to the underlying technical infrastructure in response to changing legal, political, organisational or technical environments. The European border surveillance system (Eurosur) was established by the Regulation (EU) Nº 1052/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22.10.2013 establishing the European Border Surveillance System (Eurosur) to support secure exchange of border-related information including irregular migration and cross-border crime among the corresponding national coordination centres of participating Member States and between the national coordination centres and Frontex. Eurosur communication network (ECN) enables secure exchange of Eurosur information. It is implemented as a Web-based, GIS-intensive, distributed, extensible information exchange system based on Java and OSS technologies and using a set of secure peer-to-peer Internet connections for data exchange. Eurosur communication network is currently composed of 31 nodes, each with their corresponding hardware and software, including a local copy of the information database. Additional nodes are deployed for staging and disaster recovery purposes in Frontex headquarters and in the backup data centre. The Eurosur technical management system, providing master services, distribution of centrally served map services and support to the Eurosur communication network and its nodes, is an integral part of the ECN. The maintenance and support of ECN as well as its evolution are objectives of this framework. Evolution of the network should be understood as the activities including, but not limited to, design, development, implementation and deployment of the new functionalities and the underlying infrastructure. Additionally Frontex might request services needed to extend the ECN ecosystem by developing new categories of information sources, developing or extending applications and solutions that provide or consume Eurosur information or to introduce any kind of integration with external systems and applications. More specifically, the Framework Contract shall cover the following main areas: a) Eurosur evolution: — extension of the Eurosur communication network to new nodes to encompass additional current and future Member States, Schengen associated countries and selected EU agencies, — improving system stability and reliability of Eurosur nodes and applications suite, — extending Eurosur nodes accessibility by local users and systems, — development of Eurosur training environments, — enhancement of the Eurosur application, — enhancement and rationalisation of Eurosur infrastructure. b.
