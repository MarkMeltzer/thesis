Situation Monitoring and supporting IT systems \\n\\nOne of Frontex’ principle tasks is situation monitoring. For that purpose Frontex uses a set of IT systems \\nthat allow to compile and maintain the situational picture. These systems are built on the Microsoft and \\nESRI technology stack and their main applications are based on the ESRI Silverlight API and JavaScript. These \\nsystems are used within the EU Member States (MS) and Schengen Associate Countries (SAC) border guard \\ncommunity.   \\n \\n\\n1.2. \\n\\nScope \\n\\nThe envisaged solution is an externally hosted nautical chart  OGC compliant  web map and web map tile \\nservice  (WMS/WMTS)  that  can  be  integrated  into  Frontex  applications  allowing  to  display  maritime \\ninformation on their natural background. The web map service shall be based on an official ENC. \\n\\nThe service provided shall include the regular updates.  \\n\\nThe required map service is for planning purposes only and will not be used for navigational purposes.  \\n\\nWithin the scope of this procurement are the design and build of the service, the provision of the externally \\nhosted service and quarterly updates from the day the service is in operation.   \\n\\n1.3. \\n\\nOut of scope \\n\\nOut of scope of this procurement are:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 \\n\\nThe provision of Electronic Nautical Charts (ENC); \\n\\nNo ENC vector dataset shall be directly provided to Frontex, neither Frontex will provide ENCs \\ndatasets for web map services or updates.
